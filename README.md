Earthquake Data Analysis and Visualization
This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global earthquake data, aiming to uncover patterns and insights related to earthquake frequency, 
magnitude, depth, and geographical distribution. Through various visualizations and statistical analyses, the project provides an in-depth look at seismic activity worldwide, 
helping to identify trends, correlations, and areas of high seismic risk.

Key analyses include:

Magnitude Distribution: Exploring the frequency of earthquakes across different magnitudes.
Depth Analysis: Understanding how earthquake depth varies and examining depth measurement accuracy.
Geographical Patterns: Visualizing global earthquake locations to highlight active tectonic zones, particularly along plate boundaries.
Source Reliability: Comparing different data sources to assess the consistency of recorded magnitudes and review statuses.
Correlation of Features: Investigating relationships among features such as magnitude, depth, azimuthal gap, and the number of seismic stations.
This project provides valuable insights for seismologists, disaster preparedness agencies, and researchers interested in understanding the complex dynamics of earthquakes. 
By leveraging data visualizations and statistical methods, this project presents a comprehensive overview of earthquake data, highlighting the most significant features and trends in seismic activity.
